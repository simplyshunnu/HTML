## CREATION OF HTML
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) was created by a group of scientists and researchers at CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research) in the late 1980s. The primary individuals credited with the creation of HTML are Tim Berners-Lee and his colleague Robert Cailliau.

## Tim Berners-Lee &  Robert Cailliau

Tim Berners-Lee, a British computer scientist, is often considered the inventor of the World Wide Web. In 1989, while working at CERN, he proposed a system for information management that utilized hypertext, which laid the foundation for what would become HTML. Berners-Lee developed the first web browser called "WorldWideWeb" and the first web server. He also authored the first version of HTML along with the HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and URL (Uniform Resource Locator) standards.

Robert Cailliau, a Belgian computer scientist and engineer, collaborated closely with Tim Berners-Lee on the development of HTML and the World Wide Web. Cailliau played a crucial role in refining and documenting the HTML language, as well as advocating for its adoption.

The early versions of HTML were relatively simple and focused primarily on structuring and linking documents. Over time, HTML evolved with the introduction of new versions and standards. The development and standardization of HTML have involved contributions from various individuals and organizations, including the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), which is responsible for maintaining and updating HTML specifications.

It's important to note that while Tim Berners-Lee and Robert Cailliau played pivotal roles in the creation of HTML, the development of the web and HTML itself is the result of collaborative efforts from a broader community of researchers, programmers, and organizations.



##  MARKUP
 
 
HTML markup consists of several key components, including those called tags and their attributes, character-based data types, character references and entity references. HTML tags most commonly come in pairs like < h1 > , < /h1 >, although some represent empty elements and so are unpaired. The first tag in such a pair is the start tag, and the second is the end tag (they are also called opening tags and closing tags).

Another important component is the HTML document type declaration, which triggers standards mode rendering.

The following is an example of the classic "Hello, World!" program:

     <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
     <head>
         <title>This is a title</title>
    </head>
    <body>
    <div>
        <p>Hello world!</p>
    </div>
    </body>
    </html>
The text between <html> and </html> describes the web page, and the text between <body> and </body> is the visible page content. The markup text <title>This is a title</title> defines the browser page title shown on browser tabs and window titles and the tag <div> defines a division of the page used for easy styling. Between <head> and </head>, a <meta> element can be used to define webpage metadata.

The Document Type Declaration <!DOCTYPE html> is for HTML5. If a declaration is not included, various browsers will revert to "quirks mode" for rendering.
 
 
 
 ## ELEMENTS
 
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) consists of various elements that define the structure and content of a web page. Here are some commonly used HTML elements:

  - ###  `<h1>` to `<h6>`: Heading elements  
           # Heading 1
 
 
           ## Heading 2
 
 
           ### Heading 3
 
 
           #### Heading 4
 
 
           ##### Heading 5
 
 
           ###### Heading 6
 
 - ### `<p>`: Paragraph element
   
          This is a paragraph.
