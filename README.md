## CREATION OF HTML
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) was created by a group of scientists and researchers at CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research) in the late 1980s. The primary individuals credited with the creation of HTML are Tim Berners-Lee and his colleague Robert Cailliau.

## Tim Berners-Lee

Tim Berners-Lee, a British computer scientist, is often considered the inventor of the World Wide Web. In 1989, while working at CERN, he proposed a system for information management that utilized hypertext, which laid the foundation for what would become HTML. Berners-Lee developed the first web browser called "WorldWideWeb" and the first web server. He also authored the first version of HTML along with the HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and URL (Uniform Resource Locator) standards.

Robert Cailliau, a Belgian computer scientist and engineer, collaborated closely with Tim Berners-Lee on the development of HTML and the World Wide Web. Cailliau played a crucial role in refining and documenting the HTML language, as well as advocating for its adoption.

The early versions of HTML were relatively simple and focused primarily on structuring and linking documents. Over time, HTML evolved with the introduction of new versions and standards. The development and standardization of HTML have involved contributions from various individuals and organizations, including the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), which is responsible for maintaining and updating HTML specifications.

It's important to note that while Tim Berners-Lee and Robert Cailliau played pivotal roles in the creation of HTML, the development of the web and HTML itself is the result of collaborative efforts from a broader community of researchers, programmers, and organizations.
